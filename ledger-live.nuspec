#### Manage your crypto portfolio

- Securely execute transactions by validating them with your Ledger Hardware Wallet
- Manage your portfolio as well as 1000s of other crypto assets
- Track your portfolio

**Buy, sell, swap, stake, and any other crypto transaction services are provided by third-party service providers.*

#### Buy crypto

You can easily buy crypto with a credit/debit card or bank transfer. Choose from a range of service providers – Paypal, Ramp, MoonPay, Sardine – and select the option that works best for you.

Your crypto will land safely in your Ledger crypto wallet.

#### Swap crypto

Swapping allows you to explore different crypto assets, protect your crypto from volatility, and diversify your portfolio.

You can swap through the Ledger Live app without using fiat currencies.

#### Stake crypto

Put your crypto to work and get rewards.

You can start staking coins through the Ledger Live crypto wallet app. Track your rewards in the Earn section and discover staking opportunities across chains.

## Package Notes

The installer executed by this package was built using Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS). For advanced setup scenarios, refer to [NSIS's command-line interface documentation](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Docs/Chapter3.html#installerusage). Any desired arguments can be appended to (or optionally overriding with the `--override-arguments` switch) the package's default install arguments with the `--install-arguments` option.

---

For future upgrade operations, consider opting into Chocolatey's `useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades` feature to avoid having to pass the same arguments with each upgrade:

```shell
choco feature enable --name="'useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades'"
```
